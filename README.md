# Next-Gen Burger

## Overview

Next-Gen Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, my app will display the burger on the left side of the page 

Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works here:
